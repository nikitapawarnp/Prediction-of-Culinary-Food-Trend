# Predicting Emerging Food Trends

> Forecasting dish & cuisine momentum from Yelp reviews using NLP, networks, clustering, and deep learning.

---

## üìå Project Overview

This repository analyzes Yelp restaurant reviews to **discover and forecast emerging food trends**. We combine classic NLP (keyword/NER/topic models), **co-occurrence networks**, **K-Means clustering**, and **time-series forecasting (LSTM/Prophet)** to turn unstructured text into **actionable insights** for restaurants, suppliers, and investors. Philadelphia is used as a pilot market due to its diverse food scene and rich review density.&#x20;

---

## üéØ Research Questions

1. **What cuisines and dishes are trending** and how do they evolve over time?
2. **Which items co-occur** (are ordered/mentioned together) and how can that inform **menu combos**?
3. Can we **segment restaurants** (value vs premium vs niche) from review/metadata patterns?
4. How well can we **forecast demand** for dishes using review-time signals?
5. How do topic proportions and named entities **validate trend shifts**?&#x20;

---

## üí° Why It Matters

* **Restaurants & food brands:** plan menus, pricing, promos, and new launches with data.
* **Suppliers:** translate trend signals into **ingredient demand** and inventory plans.
* **Investors & operators:** identify **growth categories** and neighborhood opportunity zones.
* **Platforms:** improve **search, recommendations, and merchandising**.&#x20;

---

## üß± Data & Preprocessing (Philadelphia pilot)

* **Source:** Yelp business + review data (restaurants only), filtered to **open businesses**, **useful>0**, **stars > 3**, **2013‚Äì2016**, monthly rollups.
* **Final working table:** **117,869 rows √ó 8 columns** after merges/filters and CSV extraction for faster iteration.
* Rationale: positive experiences are more likely to seed sustained trends; 2013‚Äì2016 chosen to avoid major exogenous shocks.&#x20;

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

1. **Keyword Frequency Analysis**
   Monthly token pipelines to track **dish/cuisine mentions** and seasonality.&#x20;
2. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**
   Extract dish/cuisine entities (e.g., *pizza, ramen, tacos, sushi; American, Japanese, Italian, Mexican*).&#x20;
3. **Topic Modeling (LDA)**
   12-topic model; absolute & relative topic-share shifts (2013‚Üí2015) to quantify momentum.&#x20;
4. **Dish Co-occurrence Network**
   Graph of dishes mentioned together ‚Üí **combo design** and **cross-sell** candidates (e.g., *dumplings‚Äìramen‚Äìhotpot*, *BBQ‚Äìfried chicken*).&#x20;
5. **K-Means Clustering (K=4)**
   Segments: budget, mid-range, premium, specialty/niche (chosen via SSE elbow).&#x20;
6. **Time-Series Forecasting**

   * **LSTM** on monthly dish series (2013‚Äì2016).
   * **Prophet** for multi-dish baselines and seasonality diagnostics.
   * Report **MAE** by item; beverages (e.g., *smoothies, latte, espresso, matcha*) forecast best.&#x20;
7. **External Cross-Validation**
   **Google Trends** and **brand comps (e.g., Chipotle)** to verify directionality (e.g., **tacos up** vs **sushi slower**).&#x20;

## üîë Key Results (Highlights)

* **Risers & Newcomers:** **tacos, dumplings, burgers, cocktails** show strong upward momentum; **salads/coffee/steak** remain very popular.&#x20;
* **Stable Core:** **pizza, pasta, waffles** show steady baseline demand.&#x20;
* **Seasonality:** **desserts & pasta** peak in winter; **ramen & seafood** display distinct seasonal curves.&#x20;
* **Co-ordering:** tight **Asian clusters** (dumplings‚Äìramen‚Äìhotpot), **BBQ‚Äìfried chicken** synergy; **sushi** acts as a **bridge** across clusters.&#x20;
* **Restaurant Segments (K=4):** budget, mid-range/popular, high-end/loyalty, niche/specialty.&#x20;
* **Forecasting:** LSTM/Prophet indicate **2016 momentum** skewed to **healthy + global** (e.g., tofu, matcha, hummus, spinach), alongside **indulgent desserts & premium beverages**.&#x20;
* **Validation:** Google Trends & brand comps (e.g., Chipotle growth) **corroborate taco acceleration** vs slower sushi.&#x20;

## üß≠ Business Impact (Examples)

* **Menu & Promo Design:** bundle **co-occurring items** (e.g., dumplings+ramen) and time promos with **seasonal peaks** (winter comfort foods).&#x20;
* **Product & Launch:** invest in **rising global categories** (Mexican/Asian) and **better-for-you** ingredients.&#x20;
* **Inventory Planning:** align **ingredient orders** (e.g., chicken, cheese, pork, shrimp) with forecasted dish cycles.&#x20;
* **Location Strategy:** target **neighborhoods** with favorable **healthiness/trend indices** for concepts and merchandising.&#x20;

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

* **Geography & timeframe:** Philadelphia only; 2013‚Äì2016 window.&#x20;
* **Data proxies:** review mentions ‚â† exact orders; potential sampling bias.
* **Seasonality/noise:** strong seasonality and event spikes increase variance.
* **Engineering constraints:** model performance varies by item; beverages forecast best; dataset and collaboration frictions noted.&#x20;
